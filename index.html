                     <p>I have been trained in Saudi Aramco under supervision of Mr.Abdulrahman AL-Johanni and Mr. Mohammed AL-Salman in the Mechanical Southren Shops Department will known as the MSSD. From the University side, I was supervised by Dr.Fahhad Alharbi.</p>
                     <p>In this job, I was trained on reparing induction motors. That includes testing the motor preparing the coils (windings) and using the tools involved in the procedure. I was able to deliver an electric system to the company to be used in the used winding machine to count the windings in both directions. I have participated in visits arranged by MSSD for the trainees to other departments including the Aviation and Marine departments.</p><a href="">Details</a>

                     <h3>Winding Machine Counter</h3>
                     <p>This project is related to the winding machine we were using in Saudi Aramco. the problem we faced is that the machine could not count the number of windings in a coil properly. In other words, it can not deduct the reverse turns which was costing money and time, and made the whole work harder for the employees to do. In this project I have used an Arduino Nano, IR sensors, coding skills, and some physics.Thankfully, the problem was solved and I have presented the system to the manager of the MSSD department during the -QSI- quarterly safety inspection. <a href="">details</a></p>

                     <p>This personal website is one of my projects which I have done to learn more and to practice the knowledge I have. this is a great example of me learning stuff by doing. I am learning front-end web development for some time now and I have an eye on being a full-stack developer to integrate that with my electrical engineering knowledge to make wonderfull things. I know that will make wonderful things. Just hope me luck. <a href="">details</a></p>

                     <p> Personally, I love this project not because it is a ery good one but because of the memories I have about it. in this project I have worked with team of four people and it was a wonderful experience. we started learning on Raspberry Pi and so many other things in our own and managed to make a small self driving car.</p>
                     <p> We have used a raspberry pi computer to control a toy car using smart phone. We were also able to make the car follow a black-line and avoid obsticals using IR and ultrasonic sensors. <a href="">Details</a></p>

                     <h3>Repurposing an IR remote control </h3>
                     <p>This is a project I have made using an Arduino Microcontroller and any remote controler that uses infrared signals. In this project, I was able to capture the signal from the controler and use that signal in to switch an LED on and off. (or can be any electric device) connected to the Arduino. it is kind of simple but I liked it. So, I shared it here with you. It was fun jast check it out. <a href="">Details</a></p>

                        <p><q>Time waits for no one</q>. If you were able to manage your time, you will have the ultimate power. Therefor, I have always been interested in understanding different time managment techniques such as day schedualing or time boxing or setting a bar of success in your day. the result I found is that time is like many other skills can not be managed in a single way for all. also, time managment needs practice and trial and error.In short, different tasks need different time managment systems. </p>

                        <p>This is a very wide subject, but I am someone who has dived in for a while and loved programming in many different areas. I have worked on high level programming languages as well as low level ones. started my journy with C and Arduino then going to Python to work in Raspberry pi and Neural networks. Then, I have stuied Assembly for microcontrollers 8051. Now, I am working with HTML/CSS/javaScript apparently for Front-End development.</p>

               <p>Did I mentioned to you that I love reading? Well I do. I believe that writing and reading is the most important human invention and it is what made it possible for humans to accumilate knowledg and build the civilizations. As the sayings goes "think before saying and read before thinking" and "do not reinvint the wheel" so I deeply believe that reading is the essintial meaning of humans. Here, I will share with you some of the things I have read and took my attention. some of these articles might not be there for you yet just wait for it</p>
