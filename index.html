                     <p>I have been trained in Saudi Aramco under supervision of Mr.Abdulrahman AL-Johanni and Mr. Mohammed AL-Salman in the Mechanical Southren Shops Department will known as the MSSD. from the University side I was supervised by Dr.Fahhad Alharbi.</p>
                     <p>In this job, I was trained on reparing induction motors from A to Z. That includes testing the motor preparing the coils and using the tools involved in the procedure. I was able to deliver an electric system to the company to be used in the winding machine to count the windings in both directions. I have participated in visits arranged by MSSD for the trainees to other departments such as the Aviation and Marine departments.</p><a href="">details</a>

               <p>I am one of those who believe strongly in learning by doing, but that does not mean you do not study the theory first. it is all about finding the correct balance between theory and practice. here you will see some of the projects I have made using my knowledge in electrical engineering or tech in general.</p>

                     <h3>Winding Machine Counter</h3>
                     <p>This project is related to the winding machine we were using in Saudi Aramco. the problem we faced is that the machine can not count the number of windings in a coil properly. In other words, it can not deduct the reverse turns which was costing money and time. In this project I have used an Arduino Nano, IR sensors, coding skills, and some physics.Thankfully, the problem was solved and I have presented the system to the manager of the MSSD department. <a href="">details</a></p>

I am learning front-end web development for some time now and I have an eye on being full-stack developer and integrate that with my electrical engineering knowledge to make wonderfull things. I know that will make wonderful things. just hope me luck. <a href="">details</a></p>

                     <p>this is a project I have done using an Arduino Microcontroller and any remote contrl that uses infrared signals. In this project, I was able to capture the signal from the remote control using an Arduino and use that signal in controling an LED (or can be any electric device) connected to the Arduino. It was fun jast check it out. <a href="">details</a></p>

               <h2>Intersting Readings</h2>
               <p>Did I mentioned to you that I love reading? Well I do. I believe that writing and reading is the most important human invention and it is what made it possible for humans to accumilate knowledg and build the civilizations. As the sayings goes "think before saying and read before thinking" and "do not reinvint the wheel" so I deeply believe that reading is the essintial meaning of humans. Here, I will share with you some of the things I have read and took my attention. some of these articles might not be there for you yet just wait for it</p>
